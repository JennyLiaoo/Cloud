<h1>What are clouds?</h1>

    <h5>Why are some clouds yellow?</h5>
    <p>Yellowish clouds may occur in the late spring <br>through early fall months during forest fire season. <br>
        The yellow color is due to the presence of <br>pollutants in the smoke. Yellowish clouds caused <br>by the
        presence of nitrogen dioxide are sometimes <br>seen in urban areas with high air pollution levels.

<p>In meteorology, a cloud is a visible mass of liquid droplets or frozen crystals made of water or various chemicals suspended in the atmosphere above the surface of a planetary body. These suspended particles are also known as aerosols and are studied in the cloud physics branch of meteorology.</p>
<p>Terrestrial cloud formation is the result of air in Earth's atmosphere becoming saturated due to either or both of two processes: cooling of the air and adding water vapor. With sufficient saturation, precipitation will fall to the surface.</p>
